# Home Automation 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository focuses on the development of a home automation system which uses a Master Slave device approach to control the home appliances.
The Master application is a python application server using flask framework and runs on Raspberry Pi device. Which is connected to the internet directly.

The slave devices will be customized circuits mostly using Atmega328 microcontrollers programmed through Arduino Uno which will control the end connected appliances,
these circuits will interact with the Master device through Bluetooth modules (HC-05).
